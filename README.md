# Menu-scaffold

This is a very lightweight sliding nav system, which is made up of a couple different elements, which will be displayed below in a delightfully visual way:

scaffold
-nav
--nav-contents
-content

As coded, the menu just slides in from the left when needed, and slides away when not needed.
